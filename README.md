# dbms-backup-recovery
University research-based DBMS project focusing on backup and recovery techniques.


**Resarch Title:**
A Detailed Analysis of Backup and Recovery Techniques in Database Management Systems (DBMS)

## Project Overview
This repository contains a **university research-based assignment** that explores backup and recovery techniques in four popular Database Management Systems (DBMS):

- **Oracle**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Microsoft SQL Server** (relational)
- **MongoDB** (NoSQL)
  
This project focuses on how databases handle failures and ensure data consistency, availability, and reliability through different backup strategies and recovery mechanisms.


## Objectives
- Understand the importance of backup and recovery in DBMS
- Study different types of database failures
- Analyze backup strategies such as:
  - Full backup
  - Incremental backup
  - Differential backup
- Examine recovery techniques including:
- Log-based recovery
- Checkpoint-based recovery
- Compare techniques based on performance, reliability, and use cases


## Academic Context & Disclaimer
This project was completed as the final group assessment for **SEG2102 Database Management Systems** (School of Engineering and Technology, Sunway University, Malaysia).


## My Role (Team Leader)
As the **Team Leader**, my responsibilities included:
- Defining the research scope and structure
- Studying and analyzing backup and recovery concepts
- Coordinating research tasks among team members
- Reviewing technical content for accuracy
- Compiling and finalizing the IEEE-formatted report
